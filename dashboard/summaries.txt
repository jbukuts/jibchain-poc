Instead, the IRS should focus on making every instance of data access traceable and providing formal, transparent avenues for concerned employees and contractors to voice their concerns. The IRS can leverage artificial intelligence to monitor and log each instance of access to sensitive information, and establishing an \"Office of Public Integrity\" can provide a legitimate outlet for employees and contractors to request disclosure of information in the public interest.
